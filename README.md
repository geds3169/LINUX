#########################################

I am not a coder by training, if there are errors and there certainly are. Do not hesitate to advise me.

Functional script, however requiring improvement:

A menu:

* Installation of Apache / Lamp / Nginx

* Installation of Mariadb or mysql

* Creation of a user with or without home

* Creation of the virutal host configuration file and associated configuration files.

Small script supposed to install an FTP server, allowing the installation of the CMS or other on a Web server. Script not tested at present.
