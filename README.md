# Install_Lamp&Mariadb&phpMyAdmin.sh

#########################################

I am not a coder by training, if there are errors and there certainly are. Do not hesitate to advise me.

Functional script, however requiring an improvement in the "phpMyAdmin blowfish secret".
This part poses a problem for me, but nevertheless seems functional, even if it requires subsequently to have to modify the root password of mariadb because the password is auto generated.
I have tried with Vagrant provision, but cannot get it to work. So this solution is currently the best time to improve myself.

Small script supposed to install an FTP server, allowing the installation of the CMS or other on a Web server. Script not tested at present.
